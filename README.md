## Required stuff
- Sway
- Swaylock
    - Swaylock-effects, although it can be done without it, just doesn't look as nice
    - Might have to build from source, for example on Ubuntu as of 04.11.2023
- Waybar
- Rofi (althought maybe Ulauncher soon?)


## Acknowledgements

- Took a lot of inspiration from: https://github.com/luispabon/sway-dotfiles 

## TODO
- Make a install.sh?
